            University Graduates and their Pay over the Years
            <body>
                <h3 class="text-primary text-center">
                  The culture around university education has long been entrenched in the idea of prestige and pragatism. 
                  In Singapore, a large concern around the university one attends and even the degree one chooses to study 
                  is based on how much it pays in the future. 
                <br><br>        
                Singapore is known for its world-class education system, as well as for individuals who track global rankings of universities as a form of validation (Tang, 2022). 
                Professor Bernard Tan, NUSâ€™ senior vice-provost of undergraduate education, has stated that university world rankings do not adequately capture the quality and employability of graduates.
                Thus, it would be important to be able to clearly discern whether higher ranked universities such as NTU, SMU and NUS compare to similar local universities who do not rank as high in terms of employability of its graduates or whether other factors, like industry and degree play a bigger role.

                <h3 class="text-primary text-center">
                Based on the General Employment Survey conducted yearly by the Ministry of Education across the 6 autonomous universities, it can be seen that
                traditionally considered "good" schools, namely SMU, NUS and NTU who command the most prestige as a result of their long standing history,
                surprisingly do not command the highest pay from employers.
                <br><br>        
                This could of course be a result of a myriad of reasons such as data inconsistencies or response rates and biases. However, it is important to note that 
                the degree cluster or industry that one chooses could play a larger role in deciding the pay a graduate receives.
